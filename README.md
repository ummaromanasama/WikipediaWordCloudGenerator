# Wikipedia_Masked_Word_Cloud

Summary: The Wikipedia Word Cloud Generator promts the user to type in somthing they would like to lookup utilizing the Wikipedia library. With the search input, the program pulls up the corresponding Wikipedia page and generates a word cloud in color using the WordCloud library. The word cloud then opens up in a pop-up using matplotlib. You can also add a mask to your word cloud to give it a bit more personality.

Here are some word clouds I generated:
